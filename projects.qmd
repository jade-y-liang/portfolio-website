## About this Page
Below is a collection of both academic and personal projects Iâ€™ve completed using *Python*, *R*, and *SQL*.

## My Blog

Here is a [blog](https://jade-y-liang.github.io/beyond-the-dataset/) that I made while taking Programming In Computing (PIC) 16B at UCLA. This blog consists of homework assignments involving data analysis, as well as a final project! You can also paste https://jade-y-liang.github.io/beyond-the-dataset/ into your browser to view the blog.
