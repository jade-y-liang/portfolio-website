## Welcome!

I am a fourth year undergraduate at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). I am double majoring in **Mathematics** and **Statistics & Data Science**, with a **Specialization in Computing**. My fascination lies in the transformative power of data. I am particularly passionate about applying statistical methods and data-driven insights to solve real-world problems.

With a strong foundation in mathematics, programming, and data analysis, I am actively seeking internship and job opportunities in data science or analytics, where I can contribute my skills and continue to grow professionally.
